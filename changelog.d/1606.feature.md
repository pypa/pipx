Add `pipx clean` command to remove pipx data.

The new command supports selective cleanup with `--cache`, `--logs`,
`--trash`, and `--venvs` flags to remove specific components. Running
`pipx clean` without flags performs a full cleanup, removing all pipx
data and resetting to a fresh installation state. All cleanup operations
require user confirmation unless the `--force` flag is used. Use
`--verbose` for detailed output including paths and progress information.
