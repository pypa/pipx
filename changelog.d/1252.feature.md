Add `--requirement` option to `inject` command.

This reads the list of packages to inject from a text file,
can be used multiple times,
and can be used in parallel with dependencies specified
through the command line.

Each line is a separate package specifier with the same syntax as the command line.
Comments are supported with a `#` prefix.
This is a strict subset of the pip [requirements file format][pip-requirements] syntax.

If you require full pip functionality, then use the `runpip` command instead;
however, the installed packages won't be recognised as "injected".
