Add `--requirement` option to `inject` command.

This reads the list of packages to inject from a text file,
can be used multiple times,
and can be used in parallel with command line packages.

Note that this is not a full pip-requirements file.
If you require full pip features, then use the `runpip` command instead;
although the installed packages won't be recognised as "injected".
