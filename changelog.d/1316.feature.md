Add `pipx upgrade-shared` command.

This allows to create/upgrade shared libraries as a standalone command.

It might be useful to initialize shared libraries with a pinned version of pip in order to create e.g. reproducible docker images using a constraint file.

It also allows for different `--pip-args` that one would get with the `install` command.
