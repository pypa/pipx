Now that you have pipx installed, you can install a program:
```
pipx install PACKAGE
```

for example

```
pipx install pycowsay
```

You can list programs installed:
```
pipx list
```

Or you can run a program without installing it:
```
pipx run pycowsay moooo!
```

You can view documentation for all commands by running `pipx --help`.
